When I first tried to create a recurring task in Salesforce using Flow, I hit a wall.

I kept finding tutorials for how to make a task repeat manually through the UI. Or they showed how to build a scheduled flow to generate recurring tasks. But neither was a fit for the use case that I needed.

I had a **record-triggered flow** that already created tasks. I just needed one of those tasks to be recurring. And although the _due date_ would be 30 days out, it wasn't like a new task needed to be created _every_ 30 days. And I didn't want a long series of tasks either.

There were no clear tutorials for how to generate recurring tasks in record-triggered flow. So I figured it out myself. And now I‚Äôm going to show you how to do it, step by step.

## The Problem with Other Solutions
Most of the advice out there assumes you're:

- Creating a task by hand (not using Flow), or
- Building a big scheduled automation to create tasks every week

That‚Äôs fine in some cases, but as I stated above, didn't really work for my use case.

The good news? You can do it by setting a few lesser-known standard fields on the Task record.

## The Simple Solution: Repeat This Task
We‚Äôre going to walk through how to:

- Add a Create Records element to your flow
- Set the right fields to make the task repeat
- Skip the need for any scheduled flows

**What We‚Äôre Building**

You‚Äôll have a record-triggered flow that creates a task‚Äîand that task will repeat based on when the user completes the original task.

**Step 1: Understand the Fields You Need**

When you're creating a recurring task in Flow, you need to set some hidden fields that Salesforce normally uses behind the scenes when you click ‚ÄúRepeat This Task‚Äù in the UI.

Here are the key fields you‚Äôll need:

Field Name	What It Does
IsRecurrence = TRUE	Tells Salesforce this is a repeating task
RecurrenceStartDateOnly = {!$Flow.CurrentDate}	Sets the start date
RecurrenceInterval = X	How often it repeats (e.g., every 1 week)
RecurrenceTimeframe = 'W'	D = Daily, W = Weekly, M = Monthly, Y = Yearly
RecurrenceRegeneratedType = 'Recurrence' (optional)	Makes sure the new task is tied to the original

**Step 2: Add or Update Your Create Records Element**

Inside your record-triggered flow:

Add a new Create Records element (or update an existing one that creates a Task)

Set your usual Task values (like Subject, WhatId, etc.)

Then include all the recurrence fields listed above

üí° Example setup:

IsRecurrence = TRUE

RecurrenceInterval = 1

RecurrenceTimeframe = 'W' ‚Üí this means ‚Äúevery week‚Äù

RecurrenceStartDateOnly = {!$Flow.CurrentDate}

**Step 3: Test It Out**

Run your flow in debug mode or trigger it by updating/creating the right record.

Then go check the Task that was created:

You should see the due date is 30 days from the previous task's due date.

üéâ That‚Äôs It!
Now you‚Äôve got:

- A record-triggered flow that creates tasks ‚úÖ
- A repeating task that doesn‚Äôt require a schedule-triggered flow ‚úÖ
- Full control over how often the task repeats ‚úÖ
And you did it all without needing Apex or any extra logic.

**Bonus Tip: End the Repeating Task (Optional)**

Want the recurring task to stop after a while? Add this field:

This marks the task closed _at the same time_ as the Task is marked _Closed_. Therefore, the task does not repeat.
